# Description ?

This is a mini blog project I did in my 3rd year of undergraduate studies.
The project consisted in making a mini blog that also manages users.
For example a user has to log in to be able to create an article or post comments.

We used the MVC model in this project.

For the model, we used Java langage to make the communication between the database and the server.

For the database, we use the database h2 due to its lightness.

For the view, we used java Spark (to manage the server).
And for the controller we used Freemarker.
The freemarker framework uses also html and css.

We also used a bit of bootstrap to manage the grid and the responsive of the site.

# How to lunch the program ?
To launch the server, you first need Gradle, then you run the command *./gradlew run.*

To visualize the site, launch your navigator and put: loalhost://8081.
The port is 8081, you can change it in the StartServer.java file.
